# Adding Your Logo

To use your PNG logo file:

1. **Save your logo file** as `logo.png` in the `/Users/admin/certified-psychosis-website/` directory
2. **Replace the placeholder** - The website is already set up to use `logo.png`
3. **Recommended dimensions**:
   - For best quality: 600x600 pixels or larger
   - The website will automatically resize it appropriately
   - Navigation logo: 50x50px
   - Hero section logo: 300px wide (height auto-scales)

## Current Setup

The website is configured to display your logo in two places:
- **Navigation bar**: Small version (50x50px)
- **Hero section**: Large version (300px wide)

## File Location

Place your `logo.png` file in:
```
/Users/admin/certified-psychosis-website/logo.png
```

Once you add the file, refresh the website to see your logo!
